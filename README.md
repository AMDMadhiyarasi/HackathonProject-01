Abstract: AI-Based Urban Heat Zone Classification & Mitigation

The Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect contributes to rising temperatures in urban areas, impacting environmental sustainability and public health. This project aims to classify and mitigate heat zones in Tamil Nadu using Machine Learning (Random Forest) based on key environmental parameters such as temperature, NDVI (vegetation index), soil moisture, cloud cover, dew point, and precipitation. The model classifies regions into Red (High Heat), Orange (Moderate Heat), and Green (Low Heat) zones and provides region-specific mitigation strategies, such as increasing urban greenery, enhancing soil moisture retention, introducing water bodies, and implementing reflective surfaces to reduce heat impact.

The project demo will showcase real-time classification results, interactive heat maps, and tailored cooling strategies, ensuring a practical and deployable approach for UHI mitigation.
